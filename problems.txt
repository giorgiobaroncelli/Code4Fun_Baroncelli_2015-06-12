Exercises


A. Write a function that fills an array of size N with the numbers from 1 to N in random order

without duplicates

Refrain from using shuffling algorithms or framework provided methods



B. Without using framework provided methods such as Count, Getlem or similar, write a method 

which would return the Nth element from the end of a generic type singly linked list, in one 

pass.

The method will take 2 parameters:

? the index N from the end of the list

? the generic singly linked list

For example, given N = 5 and the list of integers {82, 55, 78, 92, 12, 44, 51}, the method 

should return 78.
